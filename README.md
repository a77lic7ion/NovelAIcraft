*   **AI Synopsis:** Automatically generate one-sentence scene summaries to keep your outline current.

### 📖 World-Building Codex
A dedicated repository for your Characters, Locations, Lore, and Items. Cross-reference your world-building while you write.

### 📊 Project Analytics
Visualize your story's sentiment, pacing, and character visibility. Monitor your progress with real-time word count tracking and reading time estimates.

### 🔐 Professional Security
